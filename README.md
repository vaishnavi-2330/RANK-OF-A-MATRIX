# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: 
### Step 2: 
### Step 3: Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.
### Step 4: 
## Program:
```python
#Program to find the rank of a matrix.
#Developed by: Vaishnavi T
#RegisterNumber: 212225100057
#The number of linearly independent rows or columns in a matrix is known as its rank
import numpy as np
A = [[1,2,3],[3,6,9]]
rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(A)
print(rank)
```
## Output:
